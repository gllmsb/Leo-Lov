Summary: (in english bec yes. i feel like i can explain it better)

I started with installing react and sass, After that I did my file structures. I then added components and started coding. I started coding the navbar first which wasn't so difficult. I had help from chatgpt to implement the hamburger menu for the mobile and tablet version. I have imported "import React, { useState } from 'react';" which i learned during the progress of making my navbar that useState allows me to add state management to a functional component. Which in this case, keeps track of whether the mobile menu is open or closed.

I actually did the mobile and tablet view for everything tuesday since Ive completely forgotten I was meant to do them. Continuing, i did the Header which was way more simpler than the navbar. After that I did the cards which gave me a little challenge with the styling because idk im dumb and i get confused i couldn't get the width and all four of them together in a row, however i figured it out somehow. 

I then continued with the content component thus required me the most effort to do, since i couldn't comprehend how to do the reverse the 2nd one. So basically I had one component placed in two times and the 2nd (of the same component) had to be reversed. So as my teacher explained if I can remember correctly that is, I needed a prop that could reverse through true or false. So the 2nd content component had reverse={true} in order for it to be reversed. 

The team cards was easy enough since there wasn't really much to it, i had to play a little with the styling to get it to look exactly as it needed to be.

For the Address component, I have had experienced with iframes before so it wasn't so difficult. Couldn't find the exact address though, so i figured it was made up. I placed in Mcdonalds instead. 

As for the footer, i just had a section footer inside it i had a BIG div and inside that big div i had a small div and inside that small div was 2 smaller divs, i repeated the small div and the smaller div twice since i needed 2 on the left and 2 on the right. That said, I added the contents and styled them. Thats about it. 

:D
